						<p>Securing reliable and affordable water is a persistent concern for smallholder farmers in Myanmar. Until recently, family members manually pumped water out of wells and made hundreds of trips to their plots carrying 40+ liters on their shoulders. With the country opening its borders in 2011, owning a diesel engine pump suddenly became attainable, even for low-income farmers. However, while motorized pumping brought unprecedented convenience, costs also mounted—increasing fuel costs and frequent, expensive repairs of the low-quality engines became the greatest pain points in irrigation.

					</div>			
				</div>
				<div class="row margin-top-20 margin-bottom-10">
					<p>We explored the changing landscape of irrigation in Myanmar through quantitative surveys and extensive, qualitative needfinding trips. Through this exploration we identified promising potential to introduce solar pumping for Proximity’s current and target customers. We tested various existing products in the lab and with customers, but were not satisfied with any of them: solar pumps in the market were either too expensive for our customers and too large to fit in Myanmar’s standard 2” tube wells, or too small and weak to pump for any meaningful irrigation. So, we set out to design our own.

					<p>The Lotus pump is a submersible, single-stage centrifugal pump with a BLDC motor and integrated controller. The pump is 50mm diameter at its widest point, making it the narrowest submersible solar pump of its class. It is also the most efficient of its class, with a system mechanical efficiency of over 30% with 12 meters of head. The system comes with 260W of high-quality solar panels, has a maximum flow rate of over 100 liters per minute, and maximum head of over 25 meters. All pump components were custom designed from scratch through countless iterations and tests, including the impeller, the motor and the controller. Pump prototypes were tested for tens of thousands of hours, from function tests of prototypes to engineering and production validation tests.

					<p>Designing the solar panel stand was a full project by itself. This simple and intuitive design was our solution to a multifaceted optimization problem involving cost, ease of use, ease of assembly, and capturing maximum solar energy. After many solar irradiance calculations, CAD and physical prototypes, and field visits for customer feedback, we finished with the final stand design. Our one-degree-of-freedom stand had only two unique subassemblies and no tools required for assembly, was fully collapsable for transportation, able to withstand tropical monsoon winds, and at an angle optimized to latitude capturing 96% of theoretical max from two-degree-of-freedom tracking.

					<p>The Lotus was launched and went on sale in late 2015 as Proximity’s flagship irrigation product. It included the pump, 260W of panels, the panel stand and all necessary accessories at a price of under 400USD. Close to five hundred customers use the Lotus every day, saving hundreds of dollars a year in fuel and engine repair costs. A version 2 is on its way and is scheduled to launch before the dry season in late 2019.

					<p>The Lotus is proudly made in Myanmar, with plastic and metal parts produced in-country with tooling designed in-house. The Lotus also includes several key, globally-sourced custom components, a first for Proximity. The custom motor, controller, and solar panels are made in factories in China. The injection molded impellers are shot in the US. Vendors for Lotus parts spanned the spectrum from sophisticated and specialized machining and injection molding in the US, to large-scale, custom motor and controller vendors in China, to machining and molding operations in Myanmar with minimal process control. Each vendor required a different approach in partnership, communication, and training. Check out the short film below about the challenges we overcame to manufacture the Lotus.

						<p>As the project lead for Proximity’s Lotus Solar Irrigation System, I led the team through all aspects of the design process. Starting with needfinding and a partnership with students at Stanford’s d.school, our team developed countless iterations of prototypes and tested them, both in controlled lab environments and in the field with customers. I continued to manage the team through design for manufacturing, developing and managing vendors and suppliers across 4 countries, all the way to mass production. Looking back at the Lotus project, I am extremely proud of our team’s determination to overcome the many hurdles in making the product a reality. It has also been a great privilege to meet Lotus customers since the product launched, to hear their feedback for product improvement and their stories of success thanks to the Lotus.
