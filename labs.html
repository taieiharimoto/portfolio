				</div>
				<div class="row margin-top-30 margin-bottom-20">
					<p>When founded in 2004, Proximity Designs began with offering innovative and affordable irrigation products which improved the productivity of Myanmar smallholder farmers and increased their incomes. Beginning in 2014, I led the product design team for four years, with successful product launches including the Lotus, low-pressure drip, and Shwe Phyo digital communications channel. In 2017, with the organization’s scale and growth beyond product solutions, I set out to build a new team with capacity for product, service, and business design—Proximity Labs.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row margin-top-30 margin-bottom-20">
					<p>I recruited for new positions of service designer, business designer, and design researcher, as well as bringing on several junior designers to form the 12 person Labs team. With its design projects, Labs functioned like an internal consultancy, scoping projects with and being commissioned by “clients” (Proximity’s business units). For every design project, teams were built consisting of Labs members who brought design expertise, and business unit members who were the context experts. This had the added benefit of streamlining handoff of design projects to business operations teams during piloting and launch. Labs also leveraged its unique position of working across the organization to bring a design perspective to the business units’ and the organization’s strategy and product pipelines.

				<div class="row margin-top-30 margin-bottom-20">
					<p>Building the Labs team involved much more than recruiting designers and running projects. Labs had the opportunity to fulfill a critical function at the center of the organization, and therefore required careful defining and clarifying of its role relative to other parts of the organization. To maximize Labs’ value to the businesses, we invested in on-going relationships with the business units to explore the potential for design for their customers and operations. In order to do this consistently and with high-quality, my priority was building the Labs team’s internal identity and trust, through coaching and mentoring, team visioning and planning sessions, and proactive resolution of inevitable issues.

						<p>I am most proud of building a new team of diverse people whose trust in each other made our differences a core strength. The Labs team succeeded in not only running service and business design projects, but set a structure for doing so sustainably. Labs’ brought collaboration across teams in the organization, which led to better integrated and better designed products and services for Proximity’s customers.
